Summary of Assignment 4: 
In Lab Assignment 4, various machine learning models, including Support Vector Classification (SVC), Gradient Boosting, Random Forest etc. were applied to classify vehicle motion states, with the target of accurately predicting different motion states based on sensor data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality, improving model performance. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy with different test tain conditions. Overall, this assignment was very useful in learning the key concepts, including model selection, dimensionality reduction, and performance evaluation in classification tasks.
